                                <li>A computer or laptop running the desktop version of Chrome or Firefox</li>
                                <li>MetaMask, a digital wallet used specifically with web apps</li>
                                <li>Ether, a form of digital payment that powers WonderEgg</li>

                        <p class="Faq-answer">
                            <p>To use WonderEgg, you will need to install MetaMask, a digital wallet. You will need to put money
                                in it to make your first purchase.</p>
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> A digital wallet like MetaMask acts like a bank account—treat it with
                                respect and make sure you don’t forget your password or the seed words.</p>

                        <p class="Faq-answer">
                            <p>Occasionally the ‘My Kitties’ page displays a lock screen. This happens because MetaMask locks
                                your account after a certain period of time automatically. To unlock simply click on the
                                MetaMask extension and type in your password.</p><img src="./assets/img/screenshot-locked.png"></p>

                        <p class="Faq-answer">
                            <p><strong>For U.S. citizens only:</strong> you can buy ether (ETH) in MetaMask. ETH is a digital
                                currency that enables our game to run.</p><img src="./assets/img/screenshot-buy-usa.png">
                            <p><strong>For everyone else:</strong> you will need to purchase ETH from an exchange. The easiest
                                way is using Coinbase and then transferring the ETH from your Coinbase wallet to your MetaMask
                                wallet. Unfortunately, you cannot play WonderEgg with a Coinbase wallet or any other wallets.</p>
                            <p>You cannot use USD/CAD to buy a WonderEgg—currencies need to be converted into ETH first.</p>

                        <p class="Faq-answer">
                            <p><strong>For U.S. citizens only:</strong> you are able to purchase ETH directly from the MetaMask
                                wallet using the Coinbase widget. This is more convenient and doesn’t require you to create
                                two accounts.</p>
                            <p><strong>For everyone else:</strong> you need to buy ETH from an exchange using normal fiat currency.
                                Coinbase is the easiest to setup however the choice is ultimately up to you. Copy your MetaMask
                                address but clicking on the ‘...’ then ‘Copy Address to clipboard’. Go to Coinbase and click
                                ‘Accounts’ and select your ETH Wallet and then click ‘send’. Paste the MetaMask address in
                                the box with the amount you’d like to transfer.</p>
